A single embryo, single cell time-resolved model for mouse gastrulation
=======================================================================

This repository contains all the code for reproducing the analysis from the gastrulation flow paper Mittnenzweig et al. (2021). The core analysis is done with the [metacell](https://github.com/tanaylab/metacell) R package, that also contains the code for generating the network flow model.

### Usage

After cloning the github repository, users should open an R session in the repository root directory and download/initialize the scRNA database (~ 4.7 GB): 
``` r
# Loading code and downloading required data files
source("scripts/init_db.r")

```
The repository root directory should now contain the subfolders *scripts/* containing all the R scripts, *scrna_db* containing the metacell R objects, *config/*, *data/* containing additional data generated by the scripts and *figs/paper_figs/*.

#### Regenerating plots for a specific figure
For each figure, (Figure 1-7 and S1-7), there is a corresponding script in *scripts/generate_paper_figures/*. Each script contains a function *gen_fig_xyz_plots()* at the top, that contains further subfunctions and explanations related to the analysis of that figure. E.g., for regenerating the plots of figure 1, users should run the following code:

``` r
# load metacell package
library("metacell")
# initializing the metacell scrna database
scdb_init("scrna_db")

# Generating plots of Figure 1
source("scripts/generate_paper_figures/fig_1.r")
gen_fig_1_plots()

```

#### Generating manifold graph and network flow object of wildtype embryos
Metacell objects of 



#### Single-embryo timing
To regenerate the single-embryo timing data underlying Figure 1, please run
``` r
# load metacell package
library("metacell")
# initializing the metacell scrna database
scdb_init("scrna_db")

source("scripts/single_embryo_timing.r")
gen_fig_1_plots()
embryo_ranks = gen_single_embryo_timing()

# subfunctions calculating intrinsic_rank and reference_rank of each embryo
# are contained in gen_single_embryo_timing()
```
The output data frame *embryo_ranks* was added to the single-cell metadata information of the metacell matrix object. All subsequent functions using single-embryo time information, are extracting it from the *cell_metadata* entry of the WT metacell single-cell matrix object *sing_emb_wt10*.
``` r
# load metacell package
library("metacell")
# initializing the metacell scrna database
scdb_init("scrna_db")

mat = scdb_mat("sing_emb_wt10")
md = mat@cell_metadata
```

#### Network flow parameter stability analysis
The parameter stability analysis of network flows underlying Figure S2A can be regenerated using
``` r
# regnerate data - this might take some time
source("scripts/parameter_stability_analysis.r")
gen_parameter_stability_analysis()

# replotting Figure S2A
source("scripts/generate_paper_figures/fig_s2.r")
fig_s2a()
```

#### Foxc12 chimera and tetraploid analysis
To generate specific plots of Figures 6, S6 and S7, please run the corresponding functions from *fig_6.r*, *fig_s6.r* or *fig_s7.r*. Users interested in recomputing parts of the Foxc12 chimera and tetraploid embryo analysis (not needed for regenerating the plots), should run the following functions:
``` r
library("metacell")
scdb_init("scrna_db/")

source("scripts/foxc12/generate_chimera_tetraploid_data_analysis.r")

# Chimera embryos injected with Foxc12 DKO cells
foxc_chimera_generate_time_and_cell_type_annotation()

# Chimera embryos injected with control cells
control_chimera_generate_time_and_cell_type_annotation()

# Tetraploid embryos injected with Foxc12 DKO cells
foxc_tetraploid_generate_time_and_cell_type_annotation()

# Tetraploid embryos injected with control cells
control_tetraploid_generate_time_and_cell_type_annotation()
```
This will transfer cell-type and time annotation from the wt atlas to chimera/tetraploid embryos. Output is saved in *data/chimera_tetraploid_analysis/*. Scripts involved in preprocessing plates from the chimera and tetraploid embryo analyis are saved in the *scripts/foxc12/preprocessing/*. This includes
- Gating of single cells using the FACS GFP channel
- Removing cells from extraembryonic ectoderm and parietal endoderm
- Merging each single-matrix with the wt the single-cell matrix and creating a joint single-cell graph.
See summary_preprocessing.r and the corresponding scripts for more details.
